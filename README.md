# Rt 106

Rt 106 is a scalable, containerized analytics and application framework. Rt 106
allows analytic developers the flexibility to write analytics in any language
(C++, Python, Java) and then deploy those analytics with a web application
(Node.js, Angular, Bootstrap). Rt 106 provides an SDK and base
Docker images for analytic writers and Rt 106 provides a web application framework
for constructing custom applications. Rt 106 uses service discovery and self
description to dynamically add and remove analytics to applications.
