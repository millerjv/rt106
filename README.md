Rt 106 is a scalable, containerized analytics and application framework. Rt 106
provides analytic developers the flexibility to write analytics in any language
(C++, Python, Java) and deploy analytics with a web application
(Node.js, Angular, Bootstrap). Rt 106 provides an SDK and base
Docker images for analytic writers and Rt 106 provides a web application framework
for constructing custom applications. Rt 106 uses service discovery and self
description to dynamically add and remove analytics and their UI's to applications, analytic specific
job queues to enable scaling, and an abstract REST interface to a bulk datastore to deploy
in a variety of environments (desktop, cloud). Rt 106 provides a data model that separates
source/primary data from result/derived data produced by analytics.  Rt 106 also provides
analytic execution provenance so analytic results can be documented and reproduced.
